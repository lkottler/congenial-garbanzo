This is a GUI project to solve the "Tournament Bracket" Problem:

Design and then implement a Java FX GUI program that allows user to upload a list of challengers, 
display a tournament bracket graphical user interface (GUI), 
and then allows the user to interact with the GUI to update the bracket until the winner of the tournament is determined.

It only takes in powers of 2 for team sizes, and should be able to read in team names from a file.
The seed associated with these teams goes in order from the file read, starting at 1.

There are several scenes in this program, and a static music player at the bottom.
